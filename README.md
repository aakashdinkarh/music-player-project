# music-player-project

This is a simple create-react-app to stream music from local storage of the user.
Here is how to get started with this react-app:

When the page opens up, a simple page will appear which is designed to take input audio file(s) from the user.
After files has been chosen, click on upload button.
App is redirected to new screen showing the user an audio player and the list of songs he uploaded.
The audio player will play the current song (by default first song in the list) upon clicking the play button.
The audio player have buttons to perform functions like play, pause, repeat-1 song, etc., and a volume bar to adjust the volume of the audio player.
Once the audio has been played to the end, the player plays the next song or if there is only one song it repeat the same song.
